            <h1>What's wrong with YesWeHack ft Immunefi?</h1>
            <p>Usually, platforms screw you over with their vulnerability classifications, for example.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Immunefi</h2>
            <p>
                Crypto bros have created their own <a href="https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3">severity classification system</a>.
                </br></br>
                So, a couple of weeks ago, I reported some bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer">Firedancer</a> network stack.
                But the bug reports were rejected because the bugs were in the main branch
                (now in the <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/releases/tag/v0.202.20016">production</a>),
                not in the <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/releases/tag/v0.113.20007">Mainnet-v0.113.20007</a>.
                I was like, fair enough.
                </br></br>
                After some time, I found a null dereference in the <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/releases/tag/v0.113.20007">Mainnet-v0.113.20007</a> HTTP implementation.
                Guess what happened next? </br>
                Firedancer rejected it, saying it does not fall under <i>Immunefi's severity classification system</i>.
                Now, the funny part is that Firedancer was <a href="https://github.com/firedancer-io/audits">audited</a>,
                My findings and the findings in the audits are similar, typical memory corruption bugs.
                But my disadvantage was that I was going through a rigged platform.
                </br></br>
                I am not that disappointed with <b>Immunefi;</b> It is a crypto platform, so scamming people is in its nature.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>YesWeHack</h2>
            <p>
                I selected a target on <b>YesWeHack</b> and found in total of 4 bugs.
            </p>

            <h3>You Can't Report</h3>
            <p>
                As any normal human being, first you find a bug, then create a account and then report it. Well, the first two steps were easy.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                To submit bug reports, you must first complete your <a href="https://kycnot.me/">KYC</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                At first, I was a bit skeptical, but after some time, I was like, they are European; I can trust them.
                </br>
                To my surprise, YesWeHack uses Mangopay for processing payments, and Mangopay requires you to send them a copy of your passport for <a href="https://kycnot.me/">KYC</a>.
                After reading this my reaction was: Are you ret***ed or something? 
                </br></br>
                I just want to report a bug. Who the f**k thought it was a good idea to rely on only one type of document?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Asking for some quick changes
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I, As a normie, ask them to change some bits in their server to let me report it at least.
            </br></br>
            They didnâ€™t. Instead, these incel f**ks started teaching me the philosophy of <i>ethical hacking and bug bounty platforms</i>, and why <a href="https://kycnot.me/">KYC</a> is important for <i>protection against money laundering</i>.
            </p>
            <h3>My last words</h3>
            <p>
                I am hoping for a future where things just work, without being rigged or run by incompetent people.
